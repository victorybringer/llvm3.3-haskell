-- | This module defines a simple worklist.
--
-- The worklist operates in phases.  First, it drains all of the items
-- in the "current" list.  Then it replaces the current list with the
-- "next" list.
--
-- Items are added to the worklist by placing them on this internal
-- "next" list.  The "next" list is treated as a set so that items
-- will only appear once to avoid repeated processing.
--
-- TODO: Provide a hook to sort the "next" worklist in some
-- user-specified way.  Topological sorts are often useful, for
-- example.
