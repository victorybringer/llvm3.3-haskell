# Introduction

A Haskell library for analyzing LLVM bitcode.  To convert bitcode the
format used by this library, see the llvm-data-interop package and the
haddocks for the LLVM.Analysis module.

This library attempts to provide some basic program analysis
infrastructure and aims to scale to large bitcode files.  Additional
analysis tools are welcome.

# A note on testing

Some tests in the test suite necessarily rely on names generated by
the frontend used to generate bitcode.  These internal names are not
stable and change with each frontend release.  The test suite
currently runs with clang 3.2.
