-- | Control Dependence Graphs for the LLVM IR
--
-- This module follows the definition of control dependence of Cytron et al
-- (http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=115372.115320):
--
-- Let X and Y be nodes in the CFG.  If X appears on every path from Y
-- to Exit, then X postdominates Y.  If X postdominates Y but X != Y,
-- then X strictly postdominates Y.
--
-- A CFG node Y is control dependent on a CFG node X if both:
--
--  * There is a non-null path p from X->Y such that Y postdominates
--    every node *after* X on p.
--
--  * The node Y does not strictly postdominate the node X.
--
-- This CDG formulation does not insert a dummy Start node to link
-- together all of the top-level nodes.  This just means that the set
-- of control dependencies can be empty if code will be executed
-- unconditionally.

-- | Construct the control dependence graph for a function (from its
-- CFG).  This follows the construction from chapter 9 of the
-- Munchnick Compiler Design and Implementation book.
--
-- For an input function F:
--
-- 1) Construct the CFG G for F
--
-- 2) Construct the postdominator tree PT for F
--
-- 3) Let S be the set of edges m->n in G such that n does not
--    postdominate m
--
-- 4) For each edge m->n in S, find the lowest common ancestor l of m
--    and n in the postdominator tree.  All nodes on the path from
--    l->n (not including l) in PT are control dependent on m.  If
--    there is no common ancestor (disconnected PDT because of
--    multiple exit nodes), the lowest common ancestor is then the
--    virtual exit node, so /all/ of the postdominators of n are
--    control dependent on m.
--
-- Note: the typical construction augments the CFG with a fake start
-- node.  Doing that here would be a bit complicated, so the graph
-- just isn't connected by a fake Start node.

{- Note [CDG]

We can compute the CDG based on just the blocks in the graph.  All of
the instructions in a given basic block are always at the same level
in the CDG and depend on the same control decisions as the first
instruction in the block.

We also only need to store the blocks, since any instruction looked up
has a back-pointer to its block, which will let us look it up in the
CDG.

Start by finding the set S, where we just consider connected
BasicBlocks.
